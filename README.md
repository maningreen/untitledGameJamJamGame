# how to play

wasd to move

- redirect missiles at enemies to kill them
- when enemies die they drop orbs, pick them up to heal and gain stored score
- deposit stored score at the base, the base randomly spawns on the planet
- sometimes when you pick up an orb you'll get a power up, use it as best you can
- slowly enemies will spawn more and more, and shoot faster and faster, live as long as you can
and deposit as much as you can
